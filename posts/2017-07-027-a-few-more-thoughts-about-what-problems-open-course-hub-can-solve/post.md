    'twitter:title' : A Few More Thoughts About... What Problems Open Course Hub Can Solve
    'twitter:description' : A list of key problems that Grav Open Course Hub was created to solve.

_I recently [tweeted the key problems Grav Open Course Hub was created to solve](https://twitter.com/hibbittsdesign/status/890281333011824640) for tech-savvy educators, and I thought I would share them here:_

1. Pedagogical goals are unmet by the current Learning Platform (e.g. LMS or CMS) alone
2. Student and facilitator experiences, especially multi-device, are below expectations
3. Ability to access, share and collaboratively edit course materials are too limited
4. The creation and updating of online course materials takes more time than desired
5. Once created, online course materials are difficult to reuse/update on different platforms for different contexts
6. Unable to fully apply existing Web authoring skills in current Learning Platform

So, do these challenges resonate with you? How are you currently solving them? I'd love to hear from you!
