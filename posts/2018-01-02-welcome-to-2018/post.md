Having just finished my 20th offering of [CMPT-363](https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/34140/) at SFU I will be getting back to posting more frequently about my on-going work with Grav in the field of education... stay tuned.

In the meanwhile, I await word for my most recent Grav-related proposal for the [Festival of Learning 2018](https://bccampus.ca/festival-of-learning-2018/) entitled [Delivering a Better Experience by Using the Open, Collaborative and Flexible Grav CMS – Inside or Outside of your LMS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qRwTEYTms_XQ3aiX8xR6Y9DH-K65O3e6ie5suhtAOAo/edit?usp=sharing).
